# COVID-19

## COVID-19 SESSION INFORMATION

Due to Covid-19, all Play Sessions are currently being conducted in a different manner than usual.  All clients need to show a negative Covid rapid test the day of our session.  This is not negotiable.  Regardless of how much you’ve been quarantining, haven’t been running a temperature, live alone, etc, this is required.  Remember, if I make a concession for you, you can’t trust I haven’t made one for someone else.  

We can still meet for coffee or lunch, as long as 1) we are meeting outdoors, and 2) masks are used at all times when one is not actively eating/drinking.

Phone and webCHAT sessions, audio requests, etc are still available, and have been a preference for some people during these times.
