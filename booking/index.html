<li>When looking to book a session, you will be expected to be respectful.  Please be prepared to fill out the small contact form as a start.  I will reach out to you to go over specifics, and once we’ve talked I will go over a basic outline for what your personal session will entail (as much or little detail as you’d like, to keep it comfortable but enjoyable for you).</li>
<li>I will answer any questions and go over any expectations.  When we agree we’d like to go forward booking a session, we will come up with a day, time, and place to meet up, and you will be expected to send a 20% non-refundable deposit, a phone number (you may get a Google Voice number, or something similar, for privacy), and I will need access to a face picture prior to meeting up.  This is for safety reasons, and you may give access to this in as private/non traceable manner as you feel comfortable with.  If you have a profile with one already a part of it, you are all set.  Otherwise, via email, text, a link to imgur or similar are all fine.</li>
<li>If you’d like to meet for coffee, lunch, or similar prior to booking, we can do that as well.  Some people want the reassurance of an in person meet, to get a feel for who they’ll be spending such intimate moments with.  A deposit, phone number, and face picture will still be required before this public meetup, but I aim for this to be flexible, as this is for your piece of mind.</li>
<li>Currently, you supply the session locations, and I meet up with you.  Future fully equipped dungeon accessibility is possible, but that will be later and after a relationship of sorts is established.</li>
