    <h2>What Kind of Kinks Can Be Explored?  What Is Allowed?</h2>
<p>There are so many fetishes! Some of the more popular ones I specialise in are: Foot or Boot worship, AB/DL, Mommy dynamics, CBT, Chastity, Edging, SPH, Pegging, Fisting, Watersports, Humiliation, Rough Body Play, Spanking, Praise Kink, Face Sitting/Smothering. There are many more, and please don’t be afraid to bring up your kink. There is no kink shaming here. Even if it is something I am unable to provide, you will not be made to feel uncomfortable for asking!</p>
<p>To be clear, I am not a Full Service provider. If you are seeking traditional sex/bjs/etc, you’ll have to look elsewhere.</p>
<h2>Why Do People Seek A Pro?</h2>
<p>There are many reasons a person seeks out a pro. Some people just don’t have the time to go out and find a person they resonate with, that also has their same interests. Some need discretion, and this is a way to keep their privacy.  For others, they know exactly what they want, and want an outlet to get that need met.</p>
<p>For the majority of people I see, however, I’d say that they want to explore something they’ve been curious about, or into, for a long time.  Perhaps they’re afraid to bring it up to a partner, because they aren’t sure themselves what they like about something or why.  Maybe they’re looking for guidance on their journey of getting to know this aspect of themselves.  Maybe they aren’t even sure they’ll actually like the thing they’ve been fantasising about for years, and if they’re not sure about it, the risk of bringing it up to a loved one before knowing may be daunting.</p>
<h2>What a Session Looks Like</h2>
<p>Sessions with me are a little different than your typical dominatrix.  While my clients have a fetish they wish to explore, the majority of them find it more fulfilling when a level of trust and intimacy exists.  Many want a person that they are able to feel safe enough to explore their darkest secrets, while many others want a safe place to feel taken care of.  Feeling comfortable enough to be vulnerable often leads to a more fulfilling experience.  And at the end of a session, knowing that your Domme still sees you as a person, no matter how intense, dirty, and wonderful the session was, can make a big difference in how you feel about your desires.</p>
